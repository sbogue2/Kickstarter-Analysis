# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze Kickstarter campaign data to make informed decisions for future campaign planning for Theater projects.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We first looked at the effect that launch date had on the outcomes of historical theater Kickstarter campaigns. To analyze this date, we relied on a pivot table to display the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each month.

See the pivot table below:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Secondly, we looked at the effect of goal size on theater Kickstarter campaign outcomes. We harnessed the power of Excel functions, COUNTIFS() and SUM(), to accurately import and compile data into a table to see which monetary goal range was the most successful. 

See the table below:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Theater Kickstarter campaigns were most successful when launched in May and June, and least successful when launched in December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Goal amount had a substantial effect on the outcome of theater Kickstarter campaigns. Campaigns were less than 50% successful with goals of less than $20,000 and were 100% successful with goals in the $45,000 - $49,999 range. In fact, campaigns remained very successful in the $50,000 and above range, with 90% of campaigns resulting in a success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
