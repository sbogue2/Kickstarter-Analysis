# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use historical Kickstarter campaign data to make informed decisions for future campaign planning.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We first looked at the effect that launch date had on the outcomes of historical Kickstarter campaigns. To analyze this date, we relied on a pivot table to display the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each month.

See the screenshot of the pivot table below:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
