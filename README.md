# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use historical Kickstarter campaign data to make informed decisions for future campaign planning.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We first looked at the effect that launch date had on the outcomes of historical Kickstarter campaigns. To analyze this date, we relied on a pivot table to display the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each month.

See the pivot table below:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Secondly, we looked at the effect of goal size on campaign outcomes. We harnessed the power of Excel functions, COUNTIFS() and SUM(), to accurately import and compile data into a table to see which monetary goal range was the most successful. 

See the table below:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
